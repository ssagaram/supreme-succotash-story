There once a supreme ruler in the land of succotash. His name was Mush, the leader of succotash. He ruled all of the land of 5,000 succors for over one million years. Hoewver, his time was coming to an end, and without any kids, he had to find his successor. Thus, he created the X-Games, a competition in which the winner would take over the kingdom for the years to come. The challengers stepped up to the plate: Alfred the Alpha, Bonnie the Bruiser, and Rheta the Rumbler. Let the games begin!

Mush presided over these games, and decreed that the first competition would be the ski jump. Alphred, Bonnie and Rheta each stepped up to the slope, took their jumps and each got within a meter of the other. Then, suddenly out of nowhere, eddie the eagle came soaring down the hill the took the jump. He soared throuhg the air, and landed well ahead of the three favorites. Nobody knew who we was or where he came from but he had just won this first event.
